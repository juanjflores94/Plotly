# Plotly

The main objective in this project is to create a dynamic panel that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The webpage contains three charts: a bar chart that displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button. By choosing a specific volunteer we can manipulate the data displayed on the charts.
